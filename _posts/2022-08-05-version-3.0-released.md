title: Skepticoin 3.0 released
---

In an homage to the "real" Web 3.0, this version brings absolutely nothing new to the table. Further similarities include:

* [The name was stolen from a previously failed, but well-known, project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web)
* skeptics say this version "is a long way from proving its use beyond niche applications, many of them tools aimed at crypto traders"
* If James Grimmelmann of Cornell University would ever have heard of Skepticoin, he would have surely said that it is "a promised future internet that fixes all the things people don't like about the current internet, even when it's contradictory"

Since nothing new is introduced, upgrading is not required.
