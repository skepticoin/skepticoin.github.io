## What is Skepticoin?

Skepticoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency that enables you to send money
online. It's also the central community of people who think that's bullshit.

#### What's your problem with Crypto?

Crypto-currencies are fine when viewed as a technological curiosity. If you
actually believe that blockchains are the future, that bitcoin is a store of
value, or that non-fungible tokens are anything but a scam, things get problematic.

#### Why a coin then?

Crypto-enthousiasts have an incentive to be loud about crypto-currency: the
more other people they convince, the richer they themselves become. Crypto-sceptics
are a silent majority: they have no such incentive, so you never hear them.
Skepticoin changes that, by making the sceptics invested in a coin themselves.

## Goals & motto

* 1 SC equals 1 BTC
* Not "to the moon", but "into the ground"

## Getting Started

Take a look at the [getting started section](/getting-started/)

## Get coin

Skepticoin is a "early phase" coin. This means you can probably mine some yourself, as per the instructions above.

If you have ethical objections against this, you can always go to the
[faucet](https://github.com/skepticoin/skepticoin/issues/1) to get some free coin.
