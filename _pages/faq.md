**Q:** Is this is real coin?

**A:** Skepticoin is every bit as real as Bitcoin and its many clones.

---

**Q:** Is this some kind of joke?

**A:** You can laugh all you want, but we all know you're just trying to hide your fear of missing out.

---

**Q:** Isn't this basically Dogecoin?

**A:** No. Dogecoin started as a fun and friendly internet coin, but it didn't take long before it got completely overrun
       by money-hungrey speculators of the worst kind. Skepticoin was founded on a firm disbelief in cryptocurrency. Whether
       it will be completely overrun by speculators remains to be seen.

**Q:** Is it safe to put my life savings into skepticoin?

**A:** [No](https://github.com/skepticoin/skepticoin/blob/master/docs/security.md)

---

**Q:** Is this some kind of get rich quick scheme?

**A:** If you're asking you're probably looking for one. If you're buying skepticoin in the hope that some greater fool
       will buy them from you at a higher price, just know that, on average, it's likely that you're the greatest fool.

---

**O:** I can't buy skepticoin at an exchange -- this means it's not a "real" coin!

**A:** You have that exactly backwards: Skepticoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency, which means it's independent from
       established financial institutions such as exchanges. This independence is precisely its strength! You aren't
       trying to suggest that cryptocurrency's main claim to fame is untrue, are you?

---

**O**: If you're so against cryptocurrency, starting a coin of your own is hypocritical.

**A**: The ability to hold 2 directly opposing thoughts in your head is the core of cryptocurrency. If you can't do that
       then this indeed isn't for you.

---

**O**: This thing is fugly and way too technical. It will never gain traction among a sufficiently large group of fools
       without a pretty GUI.

**A**: Patience, young grasshopper, everything at its time. First we bring in the techies who bring their thorough
       understanding of crypto-nonsense and steadfast determination to bring it all down to the ground. The tech
       illiterate are only allowed to join the lower ranks of the pyramid, so that GUI must wait a bit.
